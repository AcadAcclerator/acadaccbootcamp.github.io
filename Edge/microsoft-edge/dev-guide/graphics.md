# Graphics features

## Canvas

The [Canvas API](./graphics/canvas.md) can be used for drawing, rendering, and manipulating images and graphics on a document. The canvas can be seen as a two-dimensional drawing surface that you can use to deliver real-time graphs, animations and interactive games without having to rely upon a separate plugin.

## Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)

Scalable Vector Graphics [SVG](./graphics/SVG.md) is a language for describing two-dimensional vector and mixed vector/raster graphics in an XML format. SVG is a powerful way to add high-fidelity, easily scalable visuals to a website without the need for a plug-in or separate viewer.

## WebGL
Use [WebGL](./graphics/WebGL.md) to create dynamic 2D and 3D graphics for games and interactive content that harness the power of modern GPUs.
